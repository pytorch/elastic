# torchelastic on AWS
This directory contains scripts and libraries that help users run torchelastic
jobs on AWS.

## Prerequisites

1. Familiarity with basic AWS (EC2, Auto Scaling Groups, S3, EFS).
2. (suggested) install and setup [`awscli`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html).
3. Basic knowledge of containers (we use Docker in our examples).

## Requirements

1. `git clone https://github.com/pytorch/elastic.git`
2. `cd elastic/aws && pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. The following AWS resources:
    1. EC2 [instance profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html)
    2. [Subnet(s)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.html#create-default-subnet)
    3. [Security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#DefaultSecurityGroup)
    4. EFS volume
    5. S3 Bucket
4. [Install](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html)
  the AWS Session Manager plugin

## Quickstart

This guide shows how to get a simple torchelastic job running on AWS. `petctl`
is a commandline tool that helps run distributed jobs written with torchelastic
on EC2 instances.


```
python3 petctl.py setup
```

This will bootstrap all the AWS resources required to run a torchelastic
job. For details take a look at the CloudFormation [template](cfn/setup.yml) .

Use `--s3_bucket` and `--efs_id` to use an existing S3 bucket and EFS 
file system. Otherwise an S3 bucket and EFS volume will be created.

> **IMPORTANT** when specifying `--efs_id` you MUST ensure that NO mount targets
exist on the EFS file system. torchelastic's cfn stack will attempt to create
mount targets for the subnets it creates and WILL FAIL if the file system already
has mount targets on a different VPC. For more information refer to 
the [EFS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/accessing-fs.html). 

**TIP:** If the stack creation fails, log into the CloudFormation console, inspect
the failure reason, address the failure, then manually delete the stack and re-run
`petctl configure`.

If you are familiar with AWS or already have the resources specified in the 
**Requirements** section above, then you can follow the **Manual Setup** instructions
below and simply copy the [sample specs file](config/sample_specs.json) and fill
in the template, then run `python petctl.py configure`. 


### Write a script
If you already have a script that uses torchelastic to run distributed training,
great! Otherwise you can use the provided [imagenet example](../examples/imagenet/main.py)
or [classy vision](../examples/classy_vision/main.py). Or... this is a great time to work on one.

> If you are using `examples/imagenet/main.py` you must download the imagenet
dataset from [here](http://image-net.org/download) onto the EFS volume you specified.
The dataset will be available to the workers on `/mnt/efs/fs1/<download_dir>`.

### Run the script

We will assume that you are working with the imagenet example and that
you have downloaded the imagenet dataset to `/mnt/efs/fs1/data/imagenet/train`.
To run the script we'll use `petctl`,

``` bash
python3 aws/petctl.py run_job --size 2 --min_size 1 --max_size 3 --name ${USER}-job examples/imagenet/main.py -- --input_path /mnt/efs/fs1/data/imagenet/train
```

In the example above, the named arguments, such as, `--size` , `--min_size`, and
`--max_size` are parameters to the `run_job` sub-command of `petctl`. In the example
above, we created an **elastic** job where the initial worker `--size=2`, we are
allowed to scale down to `--min_size=1` and up to `--max_size=3`. This is used by
torchelastic's rendezvous algorithm to determine how many nodes to admit on each
re-rendezvous before considering the group *final* and start the `train_step`.
  
The other positional arguments have the form:

```
[local script] -- [script args ...]
  -- or -- 
[local directory] -- [script] [script args...]
```

If the first positional argument is a path to a script file, then the script
is uploaded to S3 and the script arguments specified after the `--` delimiter
are passed through to the script.

If the first positional argument is a directory, then a tarball of the directory
is created and uploaded to S3 and is extracted on the worker-side. In this case
the first argument after the `--` delimiter is the path to the script **relative** to the
specified directory and the rest of the arguments after the delimiter is passed 
to the script.

In our example we specified
```
petctl.py run_job [...] examples/imagenet/main.py -- --input_path /mnt/efs/fs1/data/imagenet/train
```

We could have decided to specify the directory instead
```
petctl.py run_job [...] examples -- imagenet/main.py --input_path /mnt/efs/fs1/data/imagenet/train
```

**TIP 1:** Besides a local script or directory you can run with scripts or `tar` files
that have already been uploaded to S3 or directly point it to a file or directory
on the container.
``` bash
python3 petctl.py run_job [...] s3://my-bucket/my_script.py
python3 petctl.py run_job [...] s3://my-bucket/my_dir.tar.gz -- my_script.py

# or
python3 petctl.py run_job [...] docker:///abs/path/in/container/dir -- my_script.py
python3 petctl.py run_job [...] docker://rel/path/in/container/dir/my_script.py
```

**TIP 2:** To iterate quickly, simply make changes to your local script and
upload the script to S3 using
```bash 
python3 petctl.py upload examples/imagenet/main.py s3://<bucket>/<prefix>/<job_name> 
```

**TIP 3:** Use the EFS volume attached on `/mnt/efs/fs1` on all the workers to 
save input data, checkpoints and job output.

Once the `run_job` command returns log into the EC2 console, you will see two
Auto Scaling Groups
1. etcd server 
2. workers

#### Inspect the logs
Log into the AWS CloudWatch Logs console. You should see a log group called
`torchelastic/$USER`. Under it there will be a log stream per instance with the 
name `$job_name/$instance_id` (e.g. `my_job/i0b938EXAMPLE`).

#### Troubleshooting

##### SSH
To SSH onto the worker nodes to debug/inspect the worker process use AWS 
Session Manager instead of the ec2 key pair. [Install](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html)
 the Session Manager plugin and run

``` bash
# get the instance ids of the workers
python3 petctl.py list_hosts <job_name>

# ssh onto one of the workers
awscli ssm start-session --target <instance_id>
 -- example --
awscli ssm start-session --target i-00b00EXAMPLE
```

##### Process Status and Logs
Once SSH'ed, the workers run in a docker container managed by `systemd`.
You can take a look at their console outputs by running

``` bash
# see the status of the worker
sudo systemctl status torchelastic_worker
# get the container id
sudo docker ps
# tail the container logs
sudo docker logs -f <container id>
```

> Note since we have configured the log driver to be `awslogs` tailing
the docker logs will not work. For more information see: https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/awslogs/

You can also manually stop and start the workers by running
``` bash
sudo systemctl stop torchelastic_worker
sudo systemctl start torchelastic_worker
```

> **EXERCISE:** Try stopping or adding worker(s) to see elasticity in action!
To add workers, simply increase the `desired` size of the worker autoscaling group.

##### Notable Directories
1. torchelastic_worker systemd: `/etc/systemd/service/torchelastic_worker.service`
2. torchelastic run scripts: `/var/torchelastic`


> **Note**: by design, `petctl` tries to use the least number of AWS services. This
was done intentionally to allow non-AWS users to easily transfer the functionality
to their environment. Hence it currently does not have the functionality to query
status of the job or to terminate the ASG when the job is done (there is nothing
that is monitoring the job!). In practice consider using EKS, Batch, or SageMaker.

### Stop the script
To stop the job and tear down the resources, use the `kill_job` command:

``` bash
python3 petctl.py kill_job ${USER}-job
```

You'll notice that the two ASGs created with the `run_job` command are deleted.


## Manual Setup
### Create specs file
First, lets create a launch spec. This is a simple json file that specifies
the launch configuration of EC2 instances. We have included a
[sample specs file](config/sample_specs.json) so make a copy and fill it in.
You only need to fill in the fields with `{{ AWS_Resource_Id }}`, you can leave the other
fields alone for now.

```
# cd $torchelastic_repository_root
mkdir ~/torchelastic_workspace
cp aws/config/sample_specs.json ~/torchelastic_workspace/specs.json
```

The specs file is divided into two sections: `rdzv` and `worker`. As their names
imply the `rdzv` section contains the launch specs for the instances
of the rendezvous backend (e.g. etcd). The `worker` section contains the launch
specs for the worker instances.

The following subsections describe the fields in the specs file.

#### Instance Type and Accelerator
```
    "instance_type" : "[ec2 instance type]",
    "accelerator" : "[none | gpu]",
```
The instance type specifies the EC2 instance type to use. The `accelerator`
field can either be `none` or `gpu`. If an EC2 instance that has GPU capability
is specified (e.g. `g3`, `p2`, `p3` instance families) then you must specify
`accelerator = gpu`. 

> If `accelerator=gpu` is not specified on a GPU capable instance type,
`petctl` assumes you will only use CPU and will use an AMI that does not have
CUDA nor NVIDIA drivers.

#### Subnet
Note that you can add multiple subnets. Each subnet belongs to an availability zone (AZ)
so you can spread your instances across AZs by specifying multiple subnets:

```
    "subnets" : [
      "[subnet_in_us-west-2a]",
      "[subnet_in_us-west-2b]",
      ...
    ],
```
> Some instances are not available in all AZs, make sure to create the subnet
in the AZ that supports the instance type that you plan to run your jobs on.

#### Security Group
torchelastic jobs are distributed and hence require nodes to communicate with each
other. Make sure that your security group allows all inbound traffic between
instances within the same security group.
> Optionally you may want to allow inbound SSH access in case you need to log
into the instance for debugging.

#### EC2 Instance Profile
```
    "instance_role" : "[ec2 instance profile]",
```
This is the IAM role that is used when accessing other AWS services from **within**
the EC2 instance (e.g. accessing S3 from the worker host). To learn more about
instance profiles refer to the
AWS [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html).

Refer to the `Ref: IAMRoleRendezvous` and `Ref: IAMRoleWorker` resources
in the CloudFormation [template](cfn/setup.py) for a full list of IAM policies
that must be attached to this role.

> You may wish to add other privileges to this role depending on what your workers
do. For instance, if your job writes output to S3, then you will have to attach
S3 Write IAM policy to this profile.

#### S3 Bucket and Prefix
`petctl` uploads your local script to S3 and pulls it down on the worker.
Specify the S3 bucket and prefix for this purpose:
```
    "s3_bucket" : "<YOUR S3 BUCKET NAME>",
    "s3_prefix" : "<YOUR S3 PREFIX>"
```

#### Additional Worker Specs
Workers have a couple of additional specs compared to rdzv.

##### Docker Image
```
"docker_image" : "torchelastic/examples:0.1.0rc1",
```

Note that the `worker` section in the specs file has an extra `docker_image`
configuration. This is because the workers run in a docker container whereas
the rendezvous backend (etcd) runs directly on the instance. The
`torchelastic/aws` image contains torchelastic (along with all of its dependencies)
and a few runtime utilities such as the `fetch_and_run` script that allows us
to run arbitrary user scripts. For production, you may consider creating your
own docker image with a custom `ENTRYPOINT` specific to your application.

##### EFS
An Elastic File System volume is mounted on each
worker instance (it is mounted **through** all the way to the container).
EFS acts much like NFS in terms of semantics. Use it as if you were using NFS.
You may store your input dataset, store model checkpoints, or job outputs here.

> The specified EFS volume is mounted on `/mnt/efs/fs1`. On the host and container.

### Configure `petctl`
After creating a specs file, configure `petctl`

```
python3 petctl.py configure
```

This will prompt for the **absolute** path of your specs file and the AWS region.
You can run the `configure` sub-command as many times as you wish in case you made
a mistake or you need to reconfigure `petctl`. 

You'll notice that after configuration is done, there is a config file generated
under `$HOME/.petctl`.

> This is similar to how the aws cli is configured. If you decide to skip
configuration, then you **must** pass `--specs_file` and `--region` arguments
to `petctl` each time (e.g. `petctl --sepcs_file /home/$USER/specs.json --region us-west-2`).
